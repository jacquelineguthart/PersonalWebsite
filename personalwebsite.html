    <p>“It is not the critic who counts; 
        <br>not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
        <br>or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
        <br>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, 
        <br>whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
        <br>who errs, who comes short again and again, 
        <br>because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
        <br>but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, 
        <br>the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; 
        <br>who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
        <br>and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
        <br>so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls 
        <br>who neither know victory nor defeat.”
        <br>
        <br>-Teddy Roosevelt
