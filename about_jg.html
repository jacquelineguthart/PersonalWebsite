            <p> It all started on a chilly day in November in NYC. 
                I had been working at a small ad agency with no more 
                than 20 employees for the past year. I was told I was
                being pulled onto another account that needed urgent help.
                They told me a few HTML emails were due to the client that very day
                and that they didn't have anything to give the client. The developer had gone MIA. 
                I played around with an email template we had previously made and was able to 
                make a new one by google searching a few lines of code. Somehow, my simple google searcg saved the day.
                We were able to deliver a fresh set
                of emails to the client for their CRM program that same day and the crisis was averted.
                
                I couldn't believe I pulled it off. I was an Account Exewcutive and  I didn't know any code before that day. Since then, my interest in code has exploded.

                I've worked in the advertising industry for 6+ years. Its been challenging, thrilling, inspiring, and stressful
                all at the same time. The advertising industry as a whole is known for long-hours, differnt types of personalities, and excitement. 
                I've worked on many different things as an account manager. I've project managed and launched 4 tv commercials, probably over
                20 websites at this point, have overseen the creation of entirely new brands, and I've launched different types of trade shows. I've done several
                types of social campaigns, written strategic decks, and have pitched to more business than I can count.

                <br>
                <br>
                It's an exciting industry, and I've always been at the center of it all in account management. I'm the person that speaks to the clients daily, creates timelines,
                writes contracts, forecasts budgets, and makes sure that sh** does not hit the fan. My interest in coding is a result of a crisis at work, something I never expected to 
                encounter. Its turned into a passion of mine and I find myself constantly mystified by the idea that a few lines of code can bring new ideas into being.
